Mathematically, it is expressed as \u0026ldquo;y = ax^b\u0026rdquo;, where \u0026ldquo;y\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;x\u0026rdquo; are the quantities involved, \u0026ldquo;a\u0026rdquo; is a constant, and \u0026ldquo;b\u0026rdquo; is the exponent determining the power law behavior.\nPower laws are characterized by the property that small changes in the independent variable \u0026ldquo;x\u0026rdquo; can result in large changes in the dependent variable \u0026ldquo;y\u0026rdquo;, and vice versa.","date":"2024-03-25T09:01:44-04:00","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/powerlaw/en/page/about/","tags":["about","powerlaw"],"title":"About"}]
